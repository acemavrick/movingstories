								<p>We decided that using Shub's and My(Anthony) knowlegde of coding to make a website. We felt it would make the stories more memorable as reading a newspaper is one thing, 
                                    but being able to click and interact with the newspaper would make it more memorable. The website along with the teams interviews would be the best way
                                    to tell the stories of those who haven't been heard.
                                </p>
								<p>I would just like to also give credit to those who told us their stoires as we would be nothing without them. Also thanks to the interviewers for
                                    gather the information for us to make it into a website
                                </p>
