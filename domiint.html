								<p>Alex migrated from Mexico when he was just seven years old.  However, despite being an immigrant in a new country, he quickly learned to overcome all obstacles that came his way. The hardest part of his voluntary migration was seeing his family work through many jobs to get to America. Alex was so young at the time he moved, so he has little to no recollection of it; he just knows that the pull factors in America– better education and economic opportunities– were beckoning his family to come.  He only left his immediate family, so there are many of his family members still in Mexico. Luckily, they were able to move to Texas which is “right next door”. This way, he can easily visit friends and family in Mexico with a quick road trip.</p>

								<p>  Getting used to the language was easier for Alex because he already knew small amounts of English. As a child, he would watch American shows like “Wild Kratts” so he could already recognize some English words. Furthermore, moving to Houston was a culture shock. In Mexico, everything is close by; similar to New York in a way. Cars aren’t exactly a necessity there compared to how they are in Houston. Everything is so spaced out, and for him, that took a little getting used to. Fortunately, as he grew up and started to get more familiar with this new terrain, he went to Harmony School of Discovery. A school that was filled with immigrants and other people of color that shared similar backgrounds and stories. It was easy to find like-minded friends that spoke multiple languages and had their own migration tale to tell.  Now, Alex is 17 years old and has officially and successfully navigated his way through a new country. He excels in school and has no issues with making friends or meeting new people, the best advice he can give to people about to make the same journey he did is to “get rich”.</p>
