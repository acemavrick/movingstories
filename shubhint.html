									<h1>Always Back Home: <i>Line Charlesworth</i></h1>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/viewfromhome.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>The view from Line Charlesworths's childhood home in Norway.</figcaption></div>
								<p>Line Charlesworth came to the US in 1990 as an exchange student. She wanted to learn English by living in it, so she chose a school without too many Norwegian students near Akron, Ohio.
									 She came with only one friend. When asked, Line said that leaving her kith and kin wasn't hard, as she always meant to come back home, no matter how far she goes.
									  When flying to the States, Line made a layover at New York City, where the first sight she saw was an Ikea store.
									   She didn’t explore much, and went straight to Akron. She believes that she was lucky to get a wonderful host family and to have a dependable friend.
									    When asked how she felt about staying away from home for so long, she reminisced for a while and said that it wasn’t so bad.
										 She made sure to call her family nearly every two weeks, wrote a lot of letters, and stayed busy to keep her mind off of being homesick.
										  However, she remembers that her first Christmas here was horrible. She says her host family did all they could to help her, and that “there was nothing they could do.”
										   She called her dad and said “he had to hang up…I cried so much.”</p>

								<p>After school, Line married an American and brought her kids up in the United States. She went back home often, but those visits have become rarer over time. She feels “torn,” because she has loved ones in both countries.</p>
								<p>Luckily, Line never experienced discrimination and she believes that it was because she was white. She says that she was always grouped with the “white” Americans, which she was not. She avidly dislikes discrimination, especially when it is based on color, because “you can’t just take it off.”

								<p>One thing Line would like to tell all people about immigrants would be that, “no matter where you were born, the color of your skin, your religion, people want to be safe, [... they] want to have friends and family.” “We are all looking for the same things.” Being an avid believer in “Carpe Diem,” or “Seize the day,” and she believes that a person should pick up whatever opportunities come their way. That is her best advice she can offer to all people, immigrants or not. Line does not believe in the theory that America is a melting pot; rather, she believes that America is a “salad bowl,” with everything being mixed together, but the different parts are still distinctly visible. 
								</p>
								
								<p>At the end of our interview, she recalled something that she missed from Norway: nature. “Living in Norway is like living in a national park. You step outside [..] and you are surrounded by beautiful nature.” She further goes on to say that she was a very outdoorsy person and she “grew up mountain hiking, fishing, boating, skiing, swimming,” and she really misses that.</p>
