								<p> Zainab Shabbir Moiz Ali is an immigrant from Dubai. She migrated from Dubai to Houston. This was international migration and migratory movement. It was migratory movement because she now lives in Houston. Dubai is very different from Houston. Dubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai has a lot of luxury shopping places and beautiful skyscrapers. Dubai is also known for its nightlife. Zainab mentioned, “I miss the nightlife too, in houston everything closes at 9-10, me and my friends used to go out for ice cream at 1 am...” There are also many marine animal parks. Zainab said that she loved her life there. She had many great friends and a whole life in Dubai. When her father wanted them to move, she felt upset because she would miss her friends. Her father wanted her family to move to Houston because of pull factors. Her father wanted better jobs and better opportunities. She went through voluntary migration to get to Houston. It took her a while to get used to life here in Houston. Stores are not open as late, and it is a whole new environment. </p>

								<p>She described the move as scary and nerve-racking. She was scared she wouldn’t make any friends here. Once she got to Houston, she said that she felt like she did not belong. She felt alone and isolated. She said, “The biggest challenge has been making friends. I've always had a hard time making friends and talking to strangers. My source of joy was my family and my friends back home because i knew at school i might not have friends…” She later found life here easier once she made new friends. She said, “Moving has made me be more comfortable with talking to people, and I'm more confident than I was before.” Zainab feels that even though the move was hard, she still found the light in the dark. Finally, Zainab had important advice to give to anyone who is moving to a different country. She said, “I want them to know that they are not alone and that there are other people who also go through what you're going through.” </p>
								<p>Her last piece of advice is, “Coming to a new place can be hard but if you keep your head held high and have confidence anything is possible…” Though the journey has not always been easy, Zainab enjoys life in Houston.</p>
